Todo PHP
========

Inspired by [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), this repository holds various implementations of a Todo application, written in PHP.

Specification
-------------

- Applications MUST be written in PHP.
- Applications MUST present a list of tasks.
- Applications MUST allow the addition of tasks.
- Applications MUST allow the deletion of tasks.
- Applications MUST include installation instructions or [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration.
- Applications SHOULD use a form of "remote" task storage (e.g [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [Memcache](http://memcached.org/), filesystem).
- Applications SHOULD have easy-to-read code.
- Applications SHOULD make use of [good coding practises](http://phptherightway.com).

Contributing
------------

To contribute to this project; fork, implement and submit a pull request. Your implementation should be in a folder resembling the following:

```
[framework]/[GitHub username]
```

Some examples of this...

```
aura2/pmjones/*
symfony2/dannykopping/*
laravel4/chrispitt/*
vanilla/wayneashleyberry/*
```

As an implementer, you are free to use any coding standards, framework and style you prefer. Adding an implementation will most likely lead to feedback. The goal is to learn, and to be open to learning.

There are also readme.md files in the base framework folders. These are for useful resources relating to the individual frameworks. Add to these any helpful (or interesting links) that you find relevant.
