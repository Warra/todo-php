# Yii TodoPHP Example

## Running

The app is setup to use a SQLite database, which has been included in the repo.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server and visit http://localhost/todophp/yii/m-nel/.

Everything as-is _should_ work, assuming you are using Apache and cloned the repo into your htdocs. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/cape-town-php-group/todo-php/issues) if there is anything I missed/overlooked.
